## Welcome!

This is a collection of exploratory, demonstration, and other fun projects I am working on including Large Language Model (LLM), Agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and more.


### LLM LoRA Fine-Tuning using MLX LM

Use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to improve LLM responses.
